Example of a dotnet web application with Angular, Dotnet, Docker and Kubernetes. In this project, we used many open-source projects like 
- SeaweedFS as Image Store
- ElasticSearch as Search Engine
- Keycloak for authentication
- Docker as Containerization technology
- Kubernetes as Orchestrator of containers
- PostgresSQL as Database (one for each service)
- Angular to build the web user interface
- Dotnet to build the backend
- Ingres to reroute the request to the correct service
- Registry as a close source Docker registry (alternative for DockerHub)
- GRPC is used to communicate between dotnet services synchronously
